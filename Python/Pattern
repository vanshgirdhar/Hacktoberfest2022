Programs for printing pyramid patterns in Python
 
Patterns can be printed in python using simple for loops. First outer loop is used to handle the number of rows and the Inner nested loop is used to handle the number of columns. Manipulating the print statements, different number patterns, alphabet patterns, or star patterns can be printed. 

Some of the Patterns are shown in this article. 

Simple pyramid pattern
# Python 3.x code to demonstrate star pattern
 
# Function to demonstrate printing pattern

def pypart(n):

     

    # outer loop to handle number of rows

    # n in this case

    for i in range(0, n):

     

        # inner loop to handle number of columns

        # values changing acc. to outer loop

        for j in range(0, i+1):

         

            # printing stars

            print("* ",end="")

      

        # ending line after each row

        print("\r")
 
# Driver Code

n = 5
pypart(n)
Output

* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
Approach 2: Using List in Python 3, this could be done in a simpler way



# Python 3.x code to demonstrate star pattern
 
# Function to demonstrate printing pattern

def pypart(n):

    myList = []

    for i in range(1,n+1):

        myList.append("*"*i)

    print("\n".join(myList))
 
# Driver Code

n = 5
pypart(n)
Output
*

Approach 3: Using recursion

#python3 code to print pyramid pattern using recursion

def pypart(n):

    if n==0:

        return

    else:

        pypart(n-1)

        print("* "*n)

  
# Driver Code

n = 5
pypart(n)

Output

* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
Approach 4: Using while loop 

# python3 code to print pyramid pattern using while loop
 
# input

n=5
 

i=1;j=0
# while loop check the condition until the
# condition become false. if it is true then 
# enter in to loop and print the pattern

while(i<=n):

    while(j<=i-1):

        print("* ",end="") 

        j+=1

     # printing next line for each row

    print("\r") 

    j=0;i+=1

After 180 degrees rotation
# Python 3.x code to demonstrate star pattern
 
# Function to demonstrate printing pattern

def pypart2(n):

     

    # number of spaces

    k = 2*n - 2
 

    # outer loop to handle number of rows

    for i in range(0, n):

     

        # inner loop to handle number spaces

        # values changing acc. to requirement

        for j in range(0, k):

            print(end=" ")

     

        # decrementing k after each loop

        k = k - 2

     

        # inner loop to handle number of columns

        # values changing acc. to outer loop

        for j in range(0, i+1):

         

            # printing stars

            print("* ", end="")

     

        # ending line after each row

        print("\r")
 
# Driver Code

n = 5
pypart2(n)
Output

Optimized Solution:

Here, we have to print a space (height – row) times and then print “*” row times.

For example: let height of the pyramid is 5

then , on the row number 1 we print blank space 4 times(that is 5-1 or height -row)

and then we print star 1 time(that is row times) and then a new line

then , on the row number 2 we print blank space 3 times(that is 5-2 or height -row)

and then we print star 2 times (that is row times) and then a new line

and so on….

Method: Using while loop
# python3 code to print pyramid pattern using while loop

n=5;i=0

while(i<=n):

  print(" " * (n - i) +"*" * i) 

  i+=1
Output

Method: Using for loop
#python3 code to implement above approach

height = 5

for row in range(1, height+ 1):

    print(" " * (height - row) +"*" * row)
